# Sr50-AvrSr50

## Initial structural hypothesis generation

The predicted structures of Sr50 and AvrSr50 can be found in [files](https://github.com/s-kyungyong/Sr50-AvrSr50/tree/main/files). These structures were submitted as a receptor and a ligand, respectively, to [ZDOCK](https://zdock.umassmed.edu/), [HDOCK](http://hdock.phys.hust.edu.cn/) and [ClusPro](https://cluspro.bu.edu/login.php). The default parameters were used, and no restraints were given. 

The docking models are also in [files](https://github.com/s-kyungyong/Sr50-AvrSr50/tree/main/files).M
